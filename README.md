# Types-of-Functions-ETH-AVAX-Assessment

This repository is for the project assessment of the project of the 3rd module of : solidity-avax-intermediate course of Metacrafters academy . The purpose of creating this to prove my learning and to showcase my skill as a solidity developer to the people

## Problem Statement

For this project, you will write a smart contract to create your own token on a local HardHat network. Once you have your contract, you should be able to use remix to interact with it. From remix, the contract owner should be able to mint tokens to a provided address. Any user should be able to burn and transfer tokens.

## Description
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has different functions that we will create the token and only can mint the tokens using mint function and anyone can transfer there token to anyone and can burn there own tokens using transfer and burn function in this we can check the total supply of the tokens.

## Getting Started

### Executing Program

1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
2. Open additional terminal in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. Back in the first terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Copy the address of the deployed contract
6. Go on the Remix IDE https://remix.ethereum.org/ 
7. Go to Deploy and run transactions and in the Environment select "Dev - Hardhat provider" and run the environment with default link
8. Then "At address" paste the address of the deployed contract 

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. 
And will use Remix IDE https://remix.ethereum.org/ as the Interface to work with the contract
